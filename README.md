# Two-Brush-Sliders
A Krita Python Plugin that adds a docker containing two draggable sliders to change the hardness and size of your current brush.

**Note:** If your brush size is greater than the 1000px default of this plugin, hold `]` (or whatever key is bound to *increase brush size*) until you reach your max brush size. The slider will remember that as the max brush size for the session.
